# Fancytools - Official Installer for Fancygotchi 

[Fancygotchi](https://github.com/Pwnagotchi-Unofficial/pwnagotchi-fancygotchi) is now an integral part of the Pwnagotchi, and Fancytools serves as its official installer. This plugin enhances the installation experience for Fancygotchi and introduces additional developer/debug tools along with a streamlined process to install various useful utilities.

## Installation

- The options in the config.toml should look like this for Fancygotchi (I will add a code to integrate it on fancygotchi install):
```

fancygotchi.rotation = 0
```
