# Fancytools - Official Installer for Fancygotchi 

[Fancygotchi](https://github.com/Pwnagotchi-Unofficial/pwnagotchi-fancygotchi) is now an integral part of the Pwnagotchi, and Fancytools serves as its official installer. This plugin enhances the installation experience for Fancygotchi and introduces additional developer/debug tools along with a streamlined process to install various useful utilities.

## Installation  

### General  

- Download the code and paste the fancytools.py, fancyserver.py and the fancytools folder inside your custom plugins folder. (default folder path: `/usr/local/share/pwnagotchi/custom-plugins`)
- Download the [Fancygotchi Theme](https://github.com/V0r-T3x/fancygotchi_themes) you want. Create the theme folder inside the custom plugins folder and place your theme folder inside it. (default themes folder path: `/usr/local/share/pwnagotchi/custom-plugins/themes/`)
- Restart the pwnagotchi.  
- Go to the web UI plugin page.
- Click on the enable button and refresh the page.
- The Fancytools web UI page is now available.

### Terminal  

- The first web UI table is the Terminal page.
- Internet is needed for the installation. The requirements will be installed, cmake is not always available on the base image.  
- Click on the install button.  
- Accept the confirmation pop-up and wait for the success pop-up. (the full install can take a while, be patient)  
- Wait for the page refresh.  

- Now you have a new button and the service status.  
- Click on the start button to start the ttyd service.  
- Wait for the success pop-up.  
- Wait for the page refresh.  
- The terminal is now available and you can stop the service to save ressources.  

### Fancygotchi  

- Go to the Fancygotchi tab.
- Click on the install button.
- Accept the confirmation pop-up and wait for the success pop-up.
- Wait for the pwnagotchi restart.
- The new face will appear on the screen.

### Dev  

The tool is now linked to the web UI for now, but it is accessible by the terminal.  

- Go to the terminal.
- The next command are availlable:
```
# To prompt the help manual:
fanncytools -h
# To prompt a system anonymized system report:
fancytools -d
# To enable a plugin:
fancytools -p plugin_name -e to enable
# To disable a plugin:
fancytools -p plugin_name
```
- The options in the config.toml should look like this for Fancygotchi (I will add a code to integrate it on fancygotchi install):
```
fancygotchi.theme = "pwnachu"
fancygotchi.rotation = 0
```
